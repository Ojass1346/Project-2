        Cartoon Network (often abbreviated as CN) is an American cable television channel owned by The Cartoon Network,
        Inc., a division of the Kids, Young Adults and Classics division of Warner Bros. Entertainment, itself a
        subsidiary of AT&T's WarnerMedia through its Studios and Networks Group division.

        Founded by Ted Turner (who appointed Betty Cohen as the first president of the network), the channel was
        launched on October 1, 1992, and primarily broadcasts animated television series, mostly children's programming,
        ranging from action to animated comedy. It currently operates from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET/PT on weekdays and from 8
        a.m. to 9 p.m. ET/PT on weekends. Cartoon Network primarily targets children 7–14, while its early morning
        Cartoonito block is aimed at preschoolers aged 2–6, and its overnight daypart block Adult Swim targets older
        teenagers and young adults, 18–34 (the latter is treated as a separate entity for promotional purposes and as a
        separate channel by Nielsen for ratings purposes).

        As of March 2021, Cartoon Network is available to approximately 94 million paid television households in the
        United States.
